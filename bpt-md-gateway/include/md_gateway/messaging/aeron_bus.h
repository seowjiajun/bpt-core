/// \brief Composition root that wires the Aeron-backed implementations of the messaging ports.
///
/// MdGatewayService talks to the four messaging ports (IMdControlSource +
/// IAckPublisher + IFundingRatePublisher + concrete MdPublisher) without
/// knowing how they are implemented. `AeronBus::build()` is the single
/// place that constructs the Aeron-backed concrete classes and bundles
/// them into a struct the app accepts in its constructor — swap this
/// factory for a different one (e.g. an in-memory bus for seam tests,
/// a NoopMdPublisher for bpt-tape) and the app code is unchanged.
///
/// The MD sink is exposed by concrete type rather than via an
/// `IMdPublisher` interface: venue adapters are templated on the
/// publisher type so the publish() chain inlines all the way to the
/// wire — see md_gateway/md/validating_publisher.h. Variation at the
/// MD sink is therefore a compile-time choice (which `Pub` you
/// instantiate the adapters with), not a runtime polymorphism.
///
/// Lifetime: AeronBus owns the publisher and subscriber objects but
/// hands ownership to MdGatewayService at construction; AeronBus itself is
/// a value type that can be moved out at the wiring site.
